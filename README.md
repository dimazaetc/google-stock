Implemented:
- receiving data from the server side in real time
- visual effect of price increase / decrease
- the ability to change the interval for updating tickets
- changing the theme of the application
- the ability to add tickets to the wishlist
What was used:- react-redux, redux
- react-bootstrap, CSS
- socket.io



I had no experience using tests, so it didn't work out, but I want to learn
The app works flawlessly. Visually beautiful and understandable.
Since there was not much time, it was also possible to implement: search, filtering, updating wishlist tickets in real time, writing tests
I would be glad to receive feedback) I look forward to
